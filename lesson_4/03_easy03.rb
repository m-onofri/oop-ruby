# If we have this code:

class Greeting
  def greet(message)
    puts message
  end
end

class Hello < Greeting
  def hi
    greet("Hello")
  end

  def self.hi
    greeting = Greeting.new
    greeting.greet("Hello")
  end
end

class Goodbye < Greeting
  def bye
    greet("Goodbye")
  end
end

# What happens in each of the following cases:

# case 1:

hello = Hello.new
hello.hi                  # => "Hello"

# case 2:

hello = Hello.new
hello.bye                 # => it throws an error

# case 3:

hello = Hello.new
hello.greet               # => it throws an error

# case 4:

hello = Hello.new
hello.greet("Goodbye")    # => "Goodbye"

# case 5:

Hello.hi                  # => it throws an error


# If we call Hello.hi we get an error message. How would you fix this?


# When objects are created they are a separate realization of a 
# particular class.

# Given the class below, how do we create two different instances 
# of this class, both with separate names and ages?

class AngryCat
  def initialize(age, name)
    @age  = age
    @name = name
  end

  def age
    puts @age
  end

  def name
    puts @name
  end

  def hiss
    puts "Hisssss!!!"
  end
end

hercules = AngryCat.new(13, "Hercules")
snoopy = AngryCat.new(1, "Snoopy")


# Given the class below, if we created a new instance of the class 
# and then called to_s on that instance we would get something 
#Â like "#<Cat:0x007ff39b356d30>"

class Cat
  attr_reader :type

  def initialize(type)
    @type = type
  end

  def to_s
    "I am a {type} cat"
  end
end

# How could we go about changing the to_s output on this method 
# to look like this: I am a tabby cat? (this is assuming that 
# "tabby" is the type we passed in during initialization).


# If I have the following class:

class Television
  def self.manufacturer
    # method logic
  end

  def model
    # method logic
  end
end

# What would happen if I called the methods like shown below?

tv = Television.new
tv.manufacturer             # => NoMethod Error
tv.model                    # => instance method execution

Television.manufacturer     # => class method execution
Television.model            # => NoMethod Error


# If we have a class such as the one below:

class Cat
  attr_accessor :type, :age

  def initialize(type)
    @type = type
    @age  = 0
  end

  def make_one_year_older
    @age += 1
  end
end

# In the make_one_year_older method we have used self.
# What is another way we could write this method so we don't have 
# to use the self prefix?


# What is used in this class but doesn't add any value?

class Light
  attr_accessor :brightness, :color

  def initialize(brightness, color)
    @brightness = brightness
    @color = color
  end

  def self.information
    return "I want to turn on the light with a brightness level of super high and a color of green"
  end
end

# Here the return inside the class method information is not required
# and actually is useless.

# Create a class called MyCar. When you initialize a new instance or object of the class, allow the 
# user to define some instance variables that tell us the year, color, and model of the car. 
# Create an instance variable that is set to 0 during instantiation of the object to track the current speed 
# of the car as well. Create instance methods that allow the car to speed up, brake, and shut the car off.

# Add an accessor method to your MyCar class to change and view the color of your car. 
# Then add an accessor method that allows you to view, but not modify, the year of your car.

# You want to create a nice interface that allows you to accurately describe the action you want your 
# program to perform. Create a method called spray_paint that can be called on an object and will modify 
# the color of the car.

# Add a class method to your MyCar class that calculates the gas mileage of any car.

# Override the to_s method to create a user friendly print out of your object.

# Create a superclass called Vehicle for your MyCar class to inherit from and move the behavior that isn't 
# specific to the MyCar class to the superclass. Create a constant in your MyCar class that stores 
# information about the vehicle that makes it different from other types of Vehicles.

# Then create a new class called MyTruck that inherits from your superclass that also has a constant 
# defined that separates it from the MyCar class in some way.

# Add a class variable to your superclass that can keep track of the number of objects created that 
# inherit from the superclass. Create a method to print out the value of this class variable as well.

# Create a module that you can mix in to ONE of your subclasses that describes a behavior unique to 
# that subclass.

# Print to the screen your method lookup for the classes that you have created.

# Move all of the methods from the MyCar class that also pertain to the MyTruck class into the Vehicle 
# class. Make sure that all of your previous method calls are working when you are finished.

# Write a method called age that calls a private method to calculate the age of the vehicle. 
# Make sure the private method is not available from outside of the class. You'll need to use 
# Ruby's built-in Time class to help.
